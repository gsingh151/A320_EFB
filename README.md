This is an enhancement mod for the FlightFactor Airbus A320 for X-Plane 11. 

This adds on to the EFB included with the plane but adds a sense of realism with addition of the announcements

# Plans
1. Implement audio pause feature
2. Only allow one audio to be played at a time
3. Create drop down menu to allow selection of other airliner tracks


# Installation

Drag all contents into data folder of the FFA320 Aircraft folder.
