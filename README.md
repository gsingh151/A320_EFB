This is an enhancement mod for the FlightFactor Airbus A320 for X-Plane 11. 

This adds on to the EFB included with the pain but adds a sense a realism with annoucements.

# Plans
1. Implement pause feature
2. Only allow one audio to be played at a time
3. Create drop down menu to allow varying selection of airliners


# Installation

Simply all contents into data/html of the FFA320 Folder.
